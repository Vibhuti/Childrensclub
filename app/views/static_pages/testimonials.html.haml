    Love and Laughter Daycare has been a part of our extended family for the last 5 years. When I needed to look for a daycare option for my older child, I visited several daycares but none of them compared to this particular daycare. I knew I made the right choice when my kid refused to come home with me in the evenings and wanted to continue playing there ! Neeta is always loving and affectionate with tke kids and I know my child will be cared for like he is at home. My older child is now in school but my younger one now goes to this daycare. There was no hesitation at all making the decision to send him here after the first one's experience. Though this is a home based daycare, it is a licensed facility and I am not apprehensive about any aspect of my child's safety or wellbeing. I am glad I chose this particular home based daycare over a bigger facility where my kid may have been lost in the crowd.

    I was very hesitant at first to leave my new 8 month old baby in the hands of strangers at a daycare, Love and Laughter playschool exceeded all my expectations. She is 2 years old now and she really enjoying going there. The best part i love there is activities. They do science projects, cooking projects, story time, Art and craft, painting, yoga, role plays etc. My daughter really enjoy it and do the same at home. She also love the food they serve. We are lucky to have you in our life and we will be always grateful and thankful for the your love.

    My son Arthur has been coming here since he was 11 months old and he is now two. Very happy with the love and care that he has received here. It is a great family atmosphere and very different from the other places that are run as a business. I would definitely recommend love and laughter daycare to all.

    When we started looking for a day care for our daughter, our main concern was to find someone who can help her develop good eating habits with patience. It turned out to be very tough for us as we tried couple of day cares before choosing love and laughter day care. Love and laughter day care has been a good choice for my daughter as she has learnt to walk, eat by herself and many other important development milestones over there. My daughter started when she was 12 months old and it's been 4 months so far. Ms Nita and her staff are excellent in terms of giving attention to every kid's needs. Food is home made and they try to feed the kids on demand apart from set schedule. My daughter started learning rhymes and repeats in her own interpretation to our amusement!

    The list goes on but more importantly we would definitely recommend the daycare to any family who is looking for a reliable and safe environment for the children.

    Wow, I really can't say enough great things about Love & Laughter Daycare, Sunnyvale. Ms. Nita and her Staff are amazing. My daughter started there 6 months ago when she was 17 months old. While she was there I always knew she was in excellent hands, I was never worried. Ms. Nita and her staff are always so caring, professional  and very attuned to each child's individual needs and habits. Not only did they help to foster my daughter's social growth but her academic growth as.There's always fun, supervised learning activities to do: painting, reading, singing, outing.

    Apart from the activities, every child gets variety of freshly prepared home food, fruits and lots of snacks which my daughter enjoys.Ms. Nita and her staff make sure that every child is fed and tries to cater every child's need.
    On a daily basis, when I pick up my daughter, Nita takes the time to tell me patiently the activities of the day, what our daughter has learned, what new things she's doing, and also what bad habits she's displaying so we can address it.
    An absolute must if you're looking for a safe, clean, loving, learning environment/home for your little one.

    My 18 month old used to go to this daycare before i lost my job. The lady Neeta is very experienced and very patient. My child ia a very fussy eatest but Neeta will make sure that kids eat well in the daycare. The place s clean. They spend lot of time outside including going around the block or to the park in their buggy. At the end of the day my kid was always well fed and well rested. Also he learnt so many rhymes at the daycare.
